        Each Therapeutic Massage treatment is tailored to the individual
        clients needs. At the start of the first session a consultation is
        carried out to ensure the correct treatment is carried out and to find
        out the clients requirements.
        <p />
        A relaxing massage performed by a skilled massage therapist can ease
        tension and anxiety and bring about a feeling of deep relaxation,
        loosen tight muscles, ease muscular aches and pains and improve the
        mobility of joints. It can also help eliminate toxins and improve
        circulation and lymph flow.
        <p />
        We offer three different treatment lengths. A fully body massage,
        which usually lasts and hour and works on the back, neck and
        shoulders, front and back of the legs and arms; although a face and
        scalp massage and foot massage can also be included. A 3/4 hour
        massage and a 1/2 hour back, neck and shoulder massage.
        <p />
        Some of the conditions that can also benefit from this treatment
        include insomnia, fatigue, anxiety, neck/ back/ shoulder stiffness or
        pain, strains, sciatica, aching hips, foot ache & arthritis to name
        but a few.

          This technique is also known as ‘on the spot’ or ‘seated massage’
          because the person is sat in an ordinary chair. Indian Head Massage
          is carried out over clothing without the use of oil. It is an
          excellent introduction to massage for those who have never
          experienced it before. The treatment concentrates on the upper back,
          neck, shoulders and head. It is especially beneficial to anyone who
          sits for prolonged periods, i.e. computer users who often experience
          pain and tension in the neck and shoulders and may be prone to eye
          strain, headaches and lapses in concentration. We demonstrated this
          therapy on central televisions ‘lifeline’ programme.
